rdfs:comment "The classification of digital health interventions (DHIs) categorizes the different ways in which digital and mobile technologies are being used to support health system needs.
Targeted primarily at public health audiences, this Classification framework aims to promote an accessible and bridging language for health program planners to articulate functionalities of digital health implementations.
Also referred to as a taxonomy, this Classification scheme is anchored on the unit of a “digital health intervention,” which represents a discrete functionality of the digital technology to achieve health sector objectives."@en.

How to use it?

The digital health interventions are organized into the following overarching groupings
based on the targeted primary user:
Interventions for clients: Clients are members of the public who are potential
or current users of health services, including health promotion activities.
Caregivers of clients receiving health services are also included in this group.
Interventions for healthcare providers: Healthcare providers are members
of the health workforce who deliver health services.
Interventions for health system or resource managers: Health system
and resource managers are involved in the administration and oversight of
public health systems. Interventions within this category reflect managerial
functions related to supply chain management, health financing, human
resource management.
Interventions for data services: This consists of crosscutting functionality to
support a wide range of activities related to data collection, management, use,
and exchange.

Worl d H e a lt h O r ga n iz atio n C las s if ic atio n​ ​o f​ ​D igital​ ​H ealt h​ ​I nt ervent ions

Each digital health intervention is accompanied by associated synonyms and other
commonly used terms. The framework also includes programmatic examples of these
terms based on cited descriptions from project documentation.

Why was it
created?

The diverse communities working in digital health—including government stakeholders,
technologists, clinicians, implementers, network operators, researchers, donors—
have lacked a mutually understandable language with which to assess and articulate
functionality. A shared and standardized vocabulary was recognized as necessary to
identify gaps and duplication, evaluate effectiveness, and facilitate alignment across
different digital health implementations.
In particular, four primary use cases prompted the development of this classification
scheme:
• synthesizing evidence and research;
• conducting national inventories and landscape analyses;
• developing guidance resources to inform planning;
• articulating required digital functionality based on identified
		health system challenges and needs.
Although frameworks such as the Control Objectives for Information and Related
Technologies (COBIT) [1], Health Level Seven (HL7) [2], and International Standards
Organization (ISO) [3] exist, these frameworks provide highly technical terms for use
by computer scientists and software developers in health. This new classification
scheme offers a simplified language to help support a dialogue between public health
practitioners and technology-oriented audiences.

How does this
link to other
classifications?

This classification of Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) should be used in tandem
with the of list Health System Challenges (HSC) in order to articulate how technology
is addressing identified health needs, such as lack of service utilisation. The HSC
framework provides an overview of needs and challenges faced in health systems,
in order to assist program planners to express what they expect to achieve through
implementation of a digital health intervention. For example, one may implement a
digital health intervention, such as “targeted communication to clients”, in order to
address a health system challenge, such as “lack of service utilisation,” to achieve an
overarching eHealth outcome of “improving clients’ access to knowledge resources and
support for better management of their health”[5].
The classification of DHIs also highlights functionalities that fit within various System
Categories, such as Logistics Management Information Systems (LMIS) or Electronic
Medical Records (EMR). System Categories represent the types of ICT applications
and information systems designed to deliver one or more digital health interventions.
A digital health intervention such as “notify stock levels of health commodities”
would fit into the System Category of LMIS. Linking digital health interventions to
system categories is critical as these serve as the starting point for interoperability
considerations.

How was it
developed?

This Classification scheme reflects emerging uses of digital technologies for health.
The taxonomy leverages mobile health (mHealth) categorizations from the mHealth
Technical Evidence Review Group (mTERG) and Labrique et al.[4], and expands on these
terms to to be inclusive of eHealth and broader capabilities that have relevance in
the health sector. WHO convened a series of technical consultations to further refine
these terminologies and definitions. Public feedback was solicited through the Health
Data Collaborative Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group. Additionally, a
desk review was conducted to align with reference frameworks [1-3], and to establish
examples of DHI in current use.

How it will
evolve?

This reference Classification will evolve as new digital functionalities emerge. The WHO
Secretariat will periodically update and version this Classification based on technical
consultations and public feedback. Subsequent releases of this Classification will be
available at http://who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/mhealth/en/.
