rdfs:comment "The classification of digital health interventions (DHIs) categorizes the different ways in which digital and mobile technologies are being used to support health system needs.
Targeted primarily at public health audiences, this Classification framework aims to promote an accessible and bridging language for health program planners to articulate functionalities of digital health implementations.
Also referred to as a taxonomy, this Classification scheme is anchored on the unit of a “digital health intervention,” which represents a discrete functionality of the digital technology to achieve health sector objectives."@en.

1.1	Communication between clients as peers within an organized network/group.
1.2	Transmission of untargeted health promotion content “in which in which relatively large, undifferentiated audiences receive identical messages.” [1] This includes message blasts usually conducted to a mobile phone user bank. The communication can be unidirectional and bidirectional.

1.2	Transmission of targeted health information “in which separate audience segments (often demographic categories) benefit from a shared message.” [1] Targeted communication can also be further customized according to an individual’s specific needs, resulting in “tailored client communication,” whereby message content is matched to the needs and preferences of an individual [1]. The communication can be unidirectional and bidirectional, but initial contact is from the health system; as opposed to on-demand information service where the client initiates the first contact to the health system. - Peer learning, peer group, peer-to-peer groups, peer network, peer support
