This may be as a result of new regulatory requirements or internal requirements. This requires that users be able to define their own query parameters and retain them. The data may be found in both structured and unstructured data. Providers and administrators also need to query for the absence of specific clinical or administrative data. For example, the Quality Control department may be reviewing whether or not the protocol for management of Diabetes Mellitus is being followed. If the protocol calls for fasting blood sugars every 3 months at minimum, the investigator might need to run an across-patient query locating patients with diabetes who do not show an FBS result within the last 3 months. Emergency Department benchmarking reports - Key point of time include arrival time; treatment area entrance time, MD contact time; decision to admit, discharge or transfer time; and departure (left ED) time. Important intervals include, but are not limited to the “door to doctor time”, “doctor to diction time”, “admission to bed availability or departure” as well as overall length of stayA key feature of an electronic health record is its ability to support the delivery of care by enabling prior information to be found and meaningfully displayed. EHR systems should facilitate search, filtering (e.g., filtering by key word, tagged data, or diagnosis), summarization, and presentation of available data needed for patient care. Systems should enable views to be customized, for example, specific data may be organized chronologically, by clinical category, by consultant, depending on need. The views may be arranged chronologically, by problem, or other parameters, and may be filtered or sorted. Jurisdictional laws and organizational policies that prohibit certain users from accessing certain patient information must be supported."@en .

    skos:definition "Since a health care organization typically has various external and internal interoperability requirements, it must use a set of corresponding interoperability or interchange standards that will meet its connectivity and information structure, format, and semantic requirements. Information should be exchanged -- and applications should provide functionality -- in a manner that appears to be seamless to the user. To be specific, if data is received from an external source that requires a user to manually copy-and-paste that data into multiple parts of the system, the exchange is not considered to be \"seamless\". Examples of standards-based EHR information content and exchange methods include: standards-based data extracts, standards-based messages, standards-based documents (e.g., HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents), standards-based healthcare transactions, and standards-based images (e.g., Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) documents). Support for multiple interaction modes is needed to respond to differing levels of immediacy and types of exchange. For example, messaging is effective for many near-real time, asynchronous data exchange scenarios but may not be appropriate if the end-user is requesting an immediate response from a remote application. A variety of interaction modes are typically supported such as: - Unsolicited Notifications (e.g., Adam Everyman has arrived at the clinic for his scheduled appointment); - Query/Response (e.g., Query: Is Adam Everyman known to the system? Response: Yes, Adam's medical record number is 12345678); - Service Request and Response (e.g., Request: Laboratory Order for “Fasting Blood Sugar”. Response: the results of the test); - Information Interchange between organizations (e.g., in a regional health exchange or in a national health system); - Structured/discrete clinical documents (e.g., a structured clinical note); - Unstructured clinical document (e.g., dictated surgical note). Standard terminology is a fundamental part of interoperability and is described in section TI.4. Using a formal explicit information model further optimizes interoperability. An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM). Organizations typically need to deal with more than one information model and may need to develop a mapping between information models, a metamodel (that helps to explain and organize the various information models), or both."@en .

    skos:definition "Healthcare requires secure communications among various participant in the patient's circle of care: patients, doctors, nurses, chronic disease care managers, public health authorities, pharmacies, laboratories, payers, consultants etc. An effective EHRS supports communication across all relevant participants, reduces the overhead and costs of healthcare-related communications, and provides automatic tracking and reporting. The list of communication participants is determined by the care setting and may change over time.Because of concerns about scalability of the specification over time, communication participants for all care settings or across care settings are not enumerated here because it would limit the possibilities available to each care setting and implementation. However, communication between providers and between patients and providers will be supported in all appropriate care settings and across care settings. Implementation of the EHRS enables new and more effective channels of communication, significantly improving efficiency and patient care. The communication functions of the EHRS changes the way participants collaborate and distribute the work of patient care."@en .

An example of a system-triggered task is when a medication defined as for continuous use runs out, a notification task should be initiated for evaluation of the need to renew or not. Quality care implies consideration of medication continuation or renewal in light of various patient and visit factors . This requires also that the relevant information is presented to the clinician in an effective manner. The decision by the clinician must then be captured in an efficient manner and actioned by the system through task assignment and communication. Presentation of tasks to be carried out needs to be in a manner that facilitates their execution and management and needs to correspond to user preferences. For example, the list could be ordered by priority or by pharmacy phone number for efficiency."@en .

    skos:definition "A \"Task\" is a specific piece of work or duty that is assigned to a person or entity. A task often needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a deadline. Tasks are often managed by an activity (or project) tracking mechanism (e.g., as part of an automated business rule process). Tasks are determined by the specific needs of patients and practitioners in a care setting. Task creation may be automated, where appropriate. An example of a system-triggered task is when laboratory results are received electronically; a task to review the result is automatically generated and assigned to a responsible party. Tasks are at all times assigned to at least one user or role for disposition. Whether the task is assignable and to whom the task can be assigned will be determined by the specific needs of practitioners in a care setting. Task-assignment lists help users prioritize and complete assigned tasks. For example, after receiving communication (e.g., a phone call or e-mail) from a patient, the triage nurse routes or assigns a task to return the patient's call to the physician who is on call physician. Another example is for a urinalysis, the nurse routes or assigns a task to clinical staff to collect a urine specimen, and for the results to be routed to the responsible physician and person ordering the test. Task creation and assignment may be automated, where appropriate. An example is when (International Normalized Ratio) INR results are received they should be automatically routed and assigned to the staff person in the clinic responsible for managing all of the patients that are having INR tests done. Task assignment ensures that all tasks are disposed of by the appropriate person or role and allows efficient interaction of entities in the care process. When a task is assigned to more than one individual or role, an indication is required to show whether the task must be completed by all individuals/roles or if only one completion suffice."@en .

For example, this may include a patient location in a facility, a patient’s, and/or family's contact information, or a link to new laboratory results in the patient’s EHR. Other example: the linkage of prescription task to the appropriate patient care plan to facilitate follow-up actions; a task to take weights links to the ‘Weights and Vitals’ screen to record the result; a task to complete a fall assessment links to the fall assessment form to be completed. An example of a well defined task is \"Dr. Jones must review Mr. Smith's blood work results.\" Efficient workflow is facilitated by navigating to the appropriate area of the record to ensure that the appropriate test result for the correct patient is reviewed."@en .

The timeliness of certain tasks can be tracked, or reports generated, in accordance with relevant law and accreditation standards. For example, a provider is able to create a report that shows tests that have not yet been performed such as urine specimen obtained, blood work drawn, etc. Another example is that of an electronic prescribing system that would track when a refill request or prescription change is received, who it has been assigned to, the action performed, and when it was completed."@en .

    skos:definition "Interchange standards characteristically change throughout their lifecycles; those changes are often tagged with \"version\" numbers. EHR systems need to control the various versions of interchange standards that are used within an EHR implementation and accommodate changes that arise with each version.For example, if an organization migrates to version 2.5 of HL7's messaging standard, it may choose to utilize that version's specimen or blood bank information capabilities. The organization may also find that certain fields have been retained for backwards compatibility only or withdrawn altogether. The EHR-S needs to be able to handle all of these possibilities.Standards typically evolve in such a way as to protect backwards compatibility. On the other hand, sometimes there is little, or no, backwards compatibility when an organization may need to replace an entire standard with a new methodology. An example of this is migrating from HL7 v2 to HL7 v3.Interchange standards that are backward compatible support exchange among senders and receivers who are using different versions. Version control ensures that those sending information in a later version of a standard consider the difference in information content that can be interchanged effectively with receivers, who are capable of processing only earlier versions. That is, senders need to be aware of the information that receivers are unable to capture and adjust their business processes accordingly. Version control enables multiple versions of the same interchange standard to exist and be distinctly recognized over time. Since interchange standards are usually periodically updated, concurrent use of different versions may be required.Large (and/or federated) organizations typically need to use different versions of an interchange standard to meet internal organizational interoperability requirements.For example, the enterprise-wide standard might use HL7 v2.5 for laboratory messages, but some regions of the enterprise might be at a lower level.It should be possible to retire deprecated interchange standards versions when applicable business cycles are completed while maintaining obsolete versions. An example use of this is for possible claims adjustment throughout the claim’s life cycle.When interchange standards change over time, it is important that retrospective analysis and research correlate and note gaps between the different versions’ information structures to support the permanence of concepts over time."@en .

However, in some terminologies, the meaning of a concept can change over time. In any case, it is important that retrospective analysis and research maintains the ability to relate to the appropriate conceptual meaning.

    skos:definition "Since an electronic health record will replace the paper chart or other paper-based system, tasks that were based on the paper artifact must be effectively managed in the electronic environment. Functions must exist in the EHR-S that support electronically any workflow that previously depended on the existence of a physical artifact (such as the paper chart, a phone message slip) in a paper based system. Tasks differ from other more generic communication among participants in the care process because they are a call to action and target completion of a specific workflow in the context of a patient's health record (including a specific component of the record). Tasks also require disposition (final resolution). The initiator may optionally require a response. For example, in a paper based system, physically placing charts in piles for review creates a physical queue of tasks related to those charts. This queue of tasks (for example, a set of patient phone calls to be returned) must be supported electronically so that the list (of patients to be called) is visible to the appropriate user or role for disposition. The state transition (e.g., created, performed and resolved) may be managed by the user explicitly or automatically based on rules. For example, if a user has a task to signoff on a test result, that task should automatically be marked complete by the EHR when the test result linked to the task is signed in the system. Patients will become more involved in the care process by receiving tasks related to their care."@en .

It is also important to provide real-time information regarding the patient's location since they may receive ancillary services in multiple parts of the facility (e.g., in the physical therapy or diagnostic imaging departments). Note: The patient's location within a facility may also be revealed by viewing standard reports (such as an Emergency Department Log). The system should support viewing a patient's specific location in terms that may include campus, building, wing, unit, room, and/or bed. The system should support jurisdictional laws related to the patient's ability (or desire) to consent to disclose their location within a facility (e.g., it may be unlawful to require a minor child to sign a consent form regarding their location in a facility). The patient's location information within the facility should also be available even before the patient is ascribed to a specific provider within that facility.

Once a Record Entry has been retracted, it is no longer visible in standard queries, though it remains accessible in EHR audit records should evidence ever be required for legal or other exceptional circumstances.Canada Health Infoway provides the following definition for retraction: This mechanism allows an existing record to be “removed” from the EHR if it is deemed erroneous. It can also be used to reverse changes that have been made to an existing record. Once a record has been retracted, it is no longer visible in standard queries, though it remains accessible in EHR audit records should evidence ever be required for legal or other exceptional circumstances. After retracting an erroneous record, a user has the ability to resubmit a corrected record with no visible indication that there was ever a previous version. Retract generally has significant constraints upon its use because of the risks of removing data from a patient’s record that might have been used by others in making decisions. The specifics will vary by jurisdiction, and potentially even by type of data.There are times that a EHR Record Entry is created then found to be erroneous, i.e., the record may belong to another individual. In these cases, it is necessary to remove that record from view (storing it in case it may be needed for litigation or investigation purposes, etc.). After retracting an erroneous record, a user has the ability to resubmit a corrected record with no visible indication that there was ever a previous version."@en .

For example, if a Record Entry was available in pending state and a clinician accessed the information to make decisions, it is important to retain the pending version even after the final version was available.

Archived Record Entries must also include corresponding metadata to ensure logical and semantic consistency of the information for subsequent access upon restoration.The archive function should provide both an automated, configurable capability as well as a user-invoked archival function to enable selected Record Entries to be preserved, or flagged for preservation. In the first instance, rules are specified to enable the system to conduct archiving in an unattended fashion. This is often the case for periodic system maintenance requirements (e.g., nightly processing where archival, data summarization and possibly purging of information occurs). In the second instance the system should provide the ability to select Record Entries to be preserved for future reference and access, such as in the case where selected Entries need to be preserved and retained for litigation.In restoring information, it may occur that Record Entries being restored are a subset of the Entries originally archived. For example, when all Record Entries for a patient encounter were archived and only a particular set of Record Entries related to a study or result are to be restored. The system may provide for such finer granularity of restoration.Archiving and restoring of Record Entries must be performed in a timely fashion, consistent with the operational requirements of both EHR users and system and technology capabilities.The system must enable compliance with records retention according to scope of practice, organizational policy or jurisdictional law."@en .

    skos:definition "Actions are taken to support patient health. Actions are taken in provision of healthcare to individuals. Actions are taken as the result of rules-based EHR System algorithms. Actors (i.e., patients, providers, users, systems) take Actions. (Actions broadly encompass tasks, acts, procedures or services performed or provided.) The EHR System captures Actions taken and creates corresponding Record Entries. Record Entries provide persistent evidence of Action occurrence, context, disposition, facts, findings and observations. From the point of Record Entry origination to the end of its lifespan, the EHR System manages each Entry consistent with and according to scope of practice, organizational policy, and jurisdictional law. In support of individual health and in provision of healthcare to individuals, Actors perform Actions and Actions have corresponding Entries in the EHR Record, (i.e., Action instances are documented by Record Entry instances). Record Entries may be captured during the course of the Action or sometime thereafter. The Actor (author/source) of the Record Entry may be the same as an Actor performing the Action or not. The EHRS Functional Model does not specify a particular relationship of Actions and corresponding Record Entries. It may be one to one, many to one or even one to many. Actions have associated metadata (e.g., who, what, when, where, why, how, under what conditions, in what context). The corresponding Record Entry captures this metadata along with other Action and Record Entry related information. Each Record Entry also includes its own provenance metadata such as who (authoring Actor) and when (documented). Record Entries may be encapsulated to bind Actor (individual, organization, and/or system) signatures to data and metadata content and data/time of occurrence. Actions and related Record Entries capture a chronology of patient health and healthcare and also a chronology of operations and services provided in/by a healthcare enterprise. Record Entries reflect changes in health information from the time it was created, to the time it was amended, sent, received, etc. In this manner, each Record Entry serves as persistent evidence of an Action taken, enabling providers to maintain comprehensive information that may be needed for legal, business, and disclosure purposes. To satisfy these purposes, Record Entries must also be retained and persisted without alteration. Record Entries have both a lifecycle and a lifespan. Lifecycle Events include originate, retain, amend, verify, attest, access/view, de-identify, transmit/receive, and more. Lifecycle Events occur at various points in a Record Entry lifespan, always starting with a point of origination and retention (i.e., when the Entry is first created and stored). A Record Entry may have a pre and post Event state if content is modified. In this case, the original Record Entry is preserved (with signature binding) and a new Entry is created (with new signature binding). A Record Entry contains data and metadata, in multiple formats, following various conventions and standards. Included data may be tagged, and/or delimited, structured (concise, encoded, computable), or unstructured (free form, non-computable). Data may be encoded as text, document, images, audio, waveforms, in ASCII, binary or other encoding. Structured data may be characterized as being concise, encoded, computable, and may be divided into discrete fields. Examples of structured health information include: - patient residence (non-codified, but discrete field) - diastolic blood pressure (numeric) - coded laboratory result or observation - coded diagnosis - patient risk assessment questionnaire with multiple-choice answers. Unstructured data may be characterized as being free form, and/or non-computable. Unstructured health record information is information that is not divided into discrete fields AND not represented as numeric, enumerated or codified data. Examples of unstructured health record information include: - text (text message to physician) - word processing document (a letter from a family member) - image (photograph of a patient or a scanned image of insurance card) - multimedia (dictated report or a voice recording). Context may determine whether data are structured or unstructured. For example, a progress note might be standardized and structured in some systems (e.g., Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan) but unstructured in other systems. The EHR System manages Record Lifecycle Events for each Record Entry, including pre and post Event record states, continuity, persistence and related Record Audit Logs."@en .

This principle has important legal impact because it provides an account of what the provider viewed and relied on for clinical decision-making. For example, if Record Entry content was available in pending state and a clinician used the information to make decisions, it is important to retain the pending version even after the final version was available.

For example, if a physician orders an MRI, a set of diagnostic images and a radiology report will be created. As a result, the patient demographic information, the order for MRI, the diagnostic images associated with the order, and the report associated with the study must all be synchronized in order for the clinicians to receive a synchronized view the complete record (with respect to time and geographic location).Date and time need to be consistent across the applications that are part of the EHR system.Synchronization demonstrates a sequence and chain of events for reconstruction and is relevant during a legal proceeding.

Transmission may occur automatically or manually and may include small or large amounts of data. Directories and registries support communication between EHR Systems and may be organized hierarchically or in a federated fashion. For example, a patient being treated by a primary care physician for a chronic condition may become ill while out of town. The new provider’s EHR-S interrogates a local, regional, or national registry to find the patient’s previous records. From the primary care record, a remote EHR-S retrieves relevant information in conformance with applicable patient privacy and confidentiality rules.An example of local registry usage is an EHR-S application sending a query message to the Hospital Information System to retrieve a patient’s demographic data."@en .

This function depends on entity authorization and authentication to be available in the system. For example, a physician practice management application in an EHR-S might send claim attachment information to an external entity. To accomplish this, the application must use a secure routing method, which ensures that both the sender and receiving sides are authorized to engage in the information exchange. Known sources and destinations can be established in a static setup or they can be dynamically determined. Examples of a static setup are recordings of IP addresses or recordings of DNS names. For dynamic determination of known sources and destinations systems can use authentication mechanisms as described in IN.1.For example, the sending of a laboratory order from the EHRS to a laboratory system within the same organization usually uses a simple static setup for routing. In contrast sending a laboratory order to a reference laboratory outside of the organization will involve some kind of authentication process. Provision of a secure network infrastructure is beyond the scope of an EHR-S."@en .

    skos:definition "Semantic interoperability requires standard terminologies combined with a formal standard information model. An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model. Another example is the ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record Communication.A terminology provides semantic and computable identity to its concepts. Examples of terminologies that an EHR-S may support include: LOINC, SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT-4.Terminologies are use-case dependent and may or may not be realm dependent. The key is that the standard be approved by all stakeholders. For example, terminologies for public health interoperability may differ from those for healthcare quality, administrative reporting, research, etc.Formal standard terminology models enable common semantic representations by describing relationships that exist between concepts within a terminology or in different terminologies, such as exemplified in the model descriptions contained in the HL7 Common Terminology Services specification.The clinical use of standard terminologies is greatly enhanced with the ability to perform hierarchical inference searches across coded concepts. Hierarchical Inference enables searches to be conducted across sets of coded concepts stored in an EHR-S. Relationships between concepts in the terminology are used in the search to recognize child concepts of a common parent. For example, there may be a parent concept, \"penicillin containing preparations\" which has numerous child concepts, each of which represents a preparation containing a specific form of penicillin (Penicillin V, Penicillin G, etc.). Therefore, a search may be conducted to find all patients taking any form of penicillin preparation.Clinical and other terminologies may be provided through a terminology service internal or external to an EHR-S."@en .

    skos:definition "The EHR system assists care providers, public health experts and others in assessing patient and population health conditions. Healthcare can be improved if analyses are performed on a population basis to evaluate care delivery, health status and disease trends, and identify potential modifiable risk factors. The various ways of analyzing a population (cohort) can be complex. Some population-based research examines relationships between events or exposures and their corresponding outcomes. Other population based research may focus on healthcare utilization, service availability and quality of care. Population-level surveillance, monitoring of disease, and epidemiologic research involves analysis of data based on existing relationships between pre-defined and well-known data elements. These analyses utilize various data elements including demographics, education, marital status, social factors, family history of diseases, personal history (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, reading capability, hearing impairment), environmental factors (such as proximity to toxic exposures), occupational factors (such as type of occupation and industry, shift-work, training, hobby), genomic and proteomic data elements, resource utilization, problem lists, and other clinical information. The identification of new and previously unrecognized patterns of disease may require sophisticated pattern recognition analysis. Early recognition of new patterns may require data available early in the disease presentation. For example, an investigation of pneumococcal disease may involve a trend analysis of the causative serotype (laboratory data) over time, evaluated per age group of patients diagnosed with pneumonia (aggregates). Several aggregates may be identified (e.g., multiple age groups). Each aggregate then is analyzed as a group for selected data pattern(s) using data elements that include, but are not limited to, patient demographics, presenting symptoms, acute treatment regimens, occupational information, and laboratory and imaging study orders and results."@en .

    skos:definition "Population health analysts (investigators) examine health data for trends and conditions through the use of well-defined queries to create their data sets. Preparing such well-defined queries, i.e., selection criteria and parameters, used to generate a cohort can be a complex and iterative process. The investigator may desire to use pre-defined or self-constructed queries (which may be saved for reuse). During the process of defining a query, the investigator may desire to accumulate statistics regarding the results of interim queries (e.g., number of patients in the query result) to determine the suitability of the queries, and subsequently modify the final query. The investigator maintains sets of queries by constructing names that depict the cohorts, the fields comprising the queries and, perhaps, values for those fields. The resultant data set generated should be validated against the intended purpose of the query. Queries may need to be saved to support future analysis of the same (or a similar) cohort. For example, the investigator may construct an \"Insulin study for males age 65 and older\" query that is used to review patients of a specific age, gender and drug usage, then also construct an “Insulin study for females age 65 and older” query by modifying a copy of the first one. Queries may identify “static” or “dynamic” cohorts. A “static cohort” query identifies and monitors certain patients within a given cohort over time (e.g., pregnant patients who arrived in the Emergency Department in January, 2012 and followed throughout their pregnancies). A “dynamic cohort” query may identify new patients to be added periodically to a cohort (e.g., the number of pregnant patients who arrived in the Emergency Department during each month). Information compiled by using a query may need to be governed by applicable policies and regulations. For example, psychiatric data may need to be excluded from a given epidemiological investigation. The query may need to specify that subjects are de-identified or aggregates are created according to the requirements of the analysis or privacy restrictions. For example, queries may be made of de-identified aggregate subjects to evaluate possible medical products safety issues quickly and securely. Data aggregation may be used to de-identify subjects, to condense the cohort, or to sub-divide a given cohort into various \"aggregates\" (for example, by age range, geographic location, socio-economic level, or education level), depicting the quantity of records, and/or content within each aggregate. Aggregate data may need to be integrated or linked d within or across cohorts. The criteria for data aggregation also may be applied to different cohorts."@en .

The Medication Reconciliation process comprises five includes several steps: (1) develop a list of current medication list of medications that the patient is taking, (2) develop a list of medications to be prescribed or recommended (3) compare the medication information from all sources; (4) make shared and informed clinical decisions based on the comparison and provide the ability to document the interaction; and (5) communicate the updated medication information to the healthcare teams, the patient and appropriate caregivers. For example: If a patient’s pain, anticoagulation, hyperglycemia or other high risk therapy is being managed by a specialist, the healthcare team must be aware to avoid prescribing an additional equivalent of this medication.(6) Verify the patient’s/caregiver’s understanding and agreement to the patient’s medication treatment plan.(7) Standardization of shared medication information (name, dose, instructions, indications, prescriber, etc)"@en .

    skos:definition "A care provider, public health expert, or organization may wish to analyze data from cohorts,(i.e., subpopulations defined by certain characteristics or conditions). For example, cohorts can be described in terms of demographics; education and social status; health status, diseases, or outcomes; industry and occupation; or injuries. Population health analysts, such as experts in public health departments, may compile individual, and/or population information reported or otherwise gathered from multiple EHRs within the jurisdictional area for surveillance and research. Populations of one or none also can be informative. By analyzing specified data for a cohort, public health experts and care providers can monitor disease prevalence and health-related trends; evaluate behavioral, socio economical, occupational, and other impacts on health; and identify potential outbreaks and associated risk factors. Examples include:-examining a cohort of patients with measles for a common (implied) exposure, such as attending the same school - following a cohort of diabetics with out-of-range markers, or analyze them from various perspectives, such as by occupation, blood sugar range, drugs that are being used and not being used. - examining a cohort of bakers for a higher-than-expected prevalence of asthma. - Upon suspicion of a flu outbreak, reviewing a cohort of patients who have presented in the Emergency Department in the last three days complaining of breathing difficulty. - Examining cohorts of smokers with lung disease, sand-blasters with breathing disorders, adults with asthma, etc. A broad range of information is used for population health surveillance and analyses, including (but not limited to) health teatus/disease/outcomes, completion/results of recommended health screens, current or previous medical treatment data, demographics, education, marital status, social factors, family history of diseases, personal history (e.g., alcohol and tobacco use, reading capability, hearing deficiency), and environmental factors (such as occupation and industry, shift-work, hobby). The information may or may not be coded; the text may be structured or unstructured. Person-level data is used to identify persons with specified characteristics such as exposures, symptoms, risk factors, injuries, genetic markers, diseases or health outcomes that may require further care. Person-level data also is required to evaluate groupings of injuries, diseases or adverse health outcomes. Issues of access to person-level data while securing patient privacy are relevant. Data also may be monitored and analyzed in “aggregate” (for example, by age range, geographic location, socio-economic level, or education level), depicting the quantity of records, and/or content within each aggregate. Aggregates may be used to report deidentified data to public health, for example, cases of influenza-like-illness by age range.Case and population information are subject to public health reporting. Care organizations may require population health reports, for example, to measure quality of care based on health improvements for populations under the care of their providers. Statistical analyses are a key component to analyzing population health data, such as epidemiological investigations to identify relationships between risks (such as exposures or behaviors) and health conditions. Individual clinicians or healthcare organizations may employ limited capabilities in EHR systems to analyze population health data. The EHR system also should be capable of interacting with, and leveraging, the capabilities of specialized external analytical systems.The investigator may hide or mask certain aspects of epidemiological investigation information, as necessary according to scope of practice, policy, and/or law. The investigator may desire to tag or remove patients from the cohort who have relocated or died."@en .

    skos:definition "The ability to map or translate one terminology to another is fundamental to an organization in an environment where several terminologies are in play to meet different purposes. It is a common occurrence that data is captured using one terminology, but is shared using another terminology.Example: Within a healthcare organization there may be a need to map terminology concepts with the same semantic meaning to meet different purposes (e.g., between an EHRS and an external laboratory system, or between an EHRS and a billing system). Standard terminologies are evolving and maps will need to be adjusted to support this evolution and more sophisticated use of standard terminologies and maps over time.Realm specific (including local, regional, national or international) interoperability requirements can also determine the need for terminology mapping, and in many cases terminology mapping services (internal or external) can be used to satisfy these requirements.The interaction and mapping of terminologies may be called into question in a legal proceeding, when clinical decisions were documented or when semantic meaning could be misinterpreted. It is important to seek guidance, document and retain all mapping decisions for all types of terminology mapping, and to recognize when mapping may not be possible from one concept to another. The quality of mapping is dependent upon the skills and interpretation of standard terminologies and clinical information by mapping experts."@en .
